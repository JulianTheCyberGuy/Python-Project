<h1>Calculator Project</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This is a project meant to test my OOP (Object Oriented Programming) knowledge. It was written in full using Python. I used Bash to test the features however, any executor is viable when using this program.</p>
<h2>Calculator Features</h2>
  <h3>Basic Operations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Addtion</li>
      <li>Subtraction</li>
      <li>Multiplication</li>
      <li>Division</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Advanced Operation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Exponentation</li>
      <li>Modulo</li>
      <li>Square Root</li>
      <li>Factorial</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Error Handling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Division by Zero</li>
      <li>Negative Square Roots</li>
      <li>Factorial Validations</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Code Features</h2>
  <h3>Modular Structure</h3>
    <p>I've split the code into 3 main parts (Calc_Module - Main_Module - Utils_Module) I've done this to keep things organized and maintable when troubleshooting. You may also notice a Test_Calc File. I added this ensure that each function in my calculator works as attended. For this "stress test" file I used the unittest framework</p>
  <h3>User input Handlining</h3>
    <p>This Calculator can validate user input for both numbers and operation choices to prevent any unforseen crashes due to invalid data/input.</p>
<hr>
<p>It should be noted however, that this was completed in a short frame of time therefore it is most likely no where near perfect</p>
